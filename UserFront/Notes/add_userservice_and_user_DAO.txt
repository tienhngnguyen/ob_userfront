First create a service folder in src>main>java>com>userFront folder. And then create a interface called UserService.java in service folder.

And then create another folder called UserServiceImpl folder inside service folder.

Again inside UserServiceImpl folder, create a class named UserServiceImpl. 
	-give @Service annotation to register this service class to the bean and this class will implements 
		UserService.java interface.
	
Again create folder called Dao inside userFront folder. 
	-inside it create UserDao interface which extends Crudrepository. CrudRepository represents create,read,update,
	 delete(CRUD) operations.
	 
Again go to UserServiceImpl.java and do @Autowired UserDao.
	-@Autowired//based on the idea of DI. when you need some kind of instances, you ask for it, and then spring boot 
	 or the container will just give it to you based on what you need.
