After finishing add_persistance_layer for all model class, now lets open application.properties

In Application.properties file:::::

	# Set here configurations for the database connection
	
	# Connection url for the database "netgloo_blog"
	spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/OnlineBanking... here 3306 is the default port number for mysql
	
	# Username and secret
		spring.datasource.username = (username of your mysql)
		spring.datasource.password = (password of your db mysql root)
		
	# Keep the connection alive if idle for a long time (needed in production)
	spring.datasource.testWhileIdle = true
	spring.datasource.validationQuery = SELECT 1
	
	# ===============================
	# = JPA / HIBERNATE
	# ===============================
	
	# Use spring.jpa.properties.* for Hibernate native properties (the prefix is
	# stripped before adding them to the entity manager).
	
	# Show or not log for each sql query
	spring.jpa.show-sql = true
	
	# Hibernate ddl auto (create, create-drop, update): with "update" the database
	# schema will be automatically updated accordingly to java entities found in
	# the project
	spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update
	
	# Allows Hibernate to generate SQL optimized for a particular DBMS
	spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect
	
After that open pom.xml file and add dependencies of mysql dbms.
			<dependency>
				<groupId>mysql</groupId>
				<artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
			</dependency>
			
Then make sure that your mysql database is running. I have to install Mysql workbench according 
to the vedio but it encountered problem on mysql so I installed xampp. I ticked on Apache and mysql. Started both. 
and then create database name OnlineBanking. And then on application.properties file edit for username and password.
I kept password blank. And then again stop server and then run my UserFront app as spring Boot App. After that, all 
the table will automatically come to the database. Then open browser and http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ then you will 
see those tables name. While installing xampp also, we dont need to add any more dependencies, previous which i did
 for mysql will work for dependencies.
